# Online Status Demo

A simple and reusable Custom Hook to detect whether the user is online or offline, built with React, Vite, and TypeScript.

##Live Demo:
https://online-status-demo.vercel.app/



## 🚀 Purpose

This project demonstrates my understanding of Custom Hooks in React and how to interact with browser APIs like `navigator.onLine` and `window.addEventListener`. It’s designed to be clean, minimal, and production-ready for junior-level frontend development.

## 🧠 What It Shows

- ✅ How to build a reusable Custom Hook (`useOnlineStatus`)
- ✅ How to use `useEffect` and `useState` properly
- ✅ How to listen to browser events (`online` / `offline`)
- ✅ How to structure a Vite + TypeScript project professionally
- ✅ How to write clean, readable, and maintainable code

## 📦 Tech Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Browser APIs (`navigator`, `window`)

📌 Why This Matters
Custom Hooks are essential for writing clean and scalable React code. This project shows I understand how to:
- Abstract logic into reusable hooks
- Work with browser-level APIs
- Build with modern tooling (Vite + TypeScript)
- Structure code for real-world use
